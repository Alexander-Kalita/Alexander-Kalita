### Data source and data cleaning

This section is divided into two parts. At first, the data source is briefly outlined and then detailed data processing is presented.

#### Data source

The data used in this study is publicly available through Kaggle platform: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). It was collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. This dataset consists of information about 30 users devoted to physical activity, sleeping patterns and heart rate. The data has some limitations: the data was collected in a single period of time, the sample is quite small (n=30) and it is not representative of the whole fitness tracker population. Despite its limitations, the data can be used to make a preliminary analysis of the smart device usage trends and its application to Bellabeat customers and marketing strategy.

#### Processing data

With previously installed packages, the following libraries are loaded in RStudio:

```{r}
# Loading libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
```

After preliminary analysis, the research focuses on three datatsets by reading them as CSV files:

```{r}
# Reading CSV files
daily_activity <- read.csv(file = "C:/Users/Alexander_Kalita/Desktop/1_Bellabeat/1_Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/2_Activity/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Alexander_Kalita/Desktop/1_Bellabeat/1_Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/3_Sleep/dailySleep_merged.csv") 
hourly_steps <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Alexander_Kalita/Desktop/1_Bellabeat/1_Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/2_Activity/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
```

The used str() function provided some information about the internal data structure. This data was doublechecked in Google sheets.

```{r}
# Exploring the datasets
str(daily_activity)
str(daily_sleep)
str(hourly_steps)
```

It was important to distinguish unique users in each dataset.

```{r}
# Summarizing distinct users
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(daily_sleep$Id) 
n_distinct(hourly_steps$Id)
```

The date format is not consistent throughout the datasets, so the runned code helps to fix this. At first glance, the “daily_activity” code did not change much but the initial date format was m/dd/YYYY, not mm/dd/YYYY. It prevents further file merge for analysis.

```{r}
# Fixing date consistency
daily_activity$ActivityDate <- format(strptime(daily_activity$ActivityDate, "%m/%d/%Y"), "%m/%d/%Y")
daily_sleep$SleepDay <- format(strptime(daily_sleep$SleepDay, "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"), "%m/%d/%Y")
hourly_steps$ActivityHour=as.POSIXct(hourly_steps$ActivityHour, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz="UTC")
head(daily_activity$ActivityDate)
head(daily_sleep$SleepDay)
head(hourly_steps$ActivityHour)
```

The date/time columns are renamed in the datasets.

```{r}
# Renaming columns
daily_activity <- rename (daily_activity, date = ActivityDate)
daily_sleep <- rename (daily_sleep, date = SleepDay)
hourly_steps <- rename (hourly_steps, date_time = ActivityHour)
colnames(daily_activity)
colnames(daily_sleep)
colnames(hourly_steps)
```

Two files are merged: “daily_activity” and “daily_sleep” datasets. They will be further used for designing box plots and correlation analysis.

```{r}
# Merging datasets
daily_activitySleep <- merge(daily_activity, daily_sleep, by=c("Id", "date"))
head(daily_activitySleep$Id)
head(daily_activitySleep$date)
```

A new dataset includes four activity types in one column.

```{r}
# Grouping users in four categories
activity_type_data <- daily_activitySleep %>%
  summarise(
    activity_type = factor(case_when(
      SedentaryMinutes > mean(SedentaryMinutes) & LightlyActiveMinutes < mean(LightlyActiveMinutes) & FairlyActiveMinutes < mean(FairlyActiveMinutes) & VeryActiveMinutes < mean(VeryActiveMinutes) ~ "Sedentary Active",
      SedentaryMinutes < mean(SedentaryMinutes) & LightlyActiveMinutes > mean(LightlyActiveMinutes) & FairlyActiveMinutes < mean(FairlyActiveMinutes) & VeryActiveMinutes < mean(VeryActiveMinutes) ~ "Lightly Active",
      SedentaryMinutes < mean(SedentaryMinutes) & LightlyActiveMinutes < mean(LightlyActiveMinutes) & FairlyActiveMinutes > mean(FairlyActiveMinutes) & VeryActiveMinutes < mean(VeryActiveMinutes) ~ "Fairly Active",
      SedentaryMinutes < mean(SedentaryMinutes) & LightlyActiveMinutes < mean(LightlyActiveMinutes) & FairlyActiveMinutes < mean(FairlyActiveMinutes) & VeryActiveMinutes > mean(VeryActiveMinutes) ~ "Very Active",
    ),levels=c("Sedentary Active", "Lightly Active", "Fairly Active", "Very Active")), TotalMinutesAsleep, group=Id)%>%
  drop_na()
```

In table 1, the date and time columns are separated apart because time will be used as a key variable to group data for histogram in the next section.

### What does the data tell us?

The section presents basic descriptive statistics of the key variables and some important data visualizations.

#### Descriptive statistics

```{r}
# Summarizing total daily steps and activity level
daily_activity %>%
  select(TotalSteps,
         VeryActiveMinutes,
         FairlyActiveMinutes,
         LightlyActiveMinutes,
         SedentaryMinutes
         ) %>%
  summary()

# Summarizing Steps counted per hour
hourly_steps %>%
  select(StepTotal) %>%
  summary()

# Summarizing total sleep duration in minutes
daily_sleep %>%
  select(TotalMinutesAsleep) %>%
summary()
```

### Data visualization

```{r}
# Histogram: Average steps per hour in a day
hourly_steps %>%
  group_by(time) %>%
  summarize(average_steps = mean(StepTotal)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x=time, y = average_steps, fill = average_steps)) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Average steps per hour", x="", y="") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "green3", high = "red3")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

```{r}
# Boxplot: Activity type and Sleep duration
ggplot(activity_type_data, aes(activity_type, TotalMinutesAsleep, fill=activity_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Figure 2: Activity type and Sleep duration", x=NULL) +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

```{r}
# Scatterplot: Sedentary activities and Sleep duration
ggplot(data=daily_activitySleep, aes(x=SedentaryMinutes, y=TotalMinutesAsleep)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Figure 3: Sedentary activities and Sleep duration")
```

### Conclusions and recommendations
Based on the data analysis, there are some important recommendations for Bellabeat company.
